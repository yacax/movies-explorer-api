# Movie Search and Save Service - Backend Part

This repository represents the backend part of the diploma project, a service where users can search for films and save them in their personal account. The frontend part of the project is currently under development.

## Project Description

The objective of this project is to build a service that allows users to search for films and save their favourite ones in a personal space. The user enters keywords into the search bar and clicks on the "Search" button. Then, two actions are performed:

1. A request is sent to the movie data service to retrieve and save data.
2. Films corresponding to the selected genre are found and displayed as cards.

When a user saves a film, it appears in a special section of the website.
